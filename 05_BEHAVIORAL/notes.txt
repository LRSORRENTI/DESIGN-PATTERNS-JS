================================
Chain of Responsibility Pattern:
================================

Description: Allows an object to pass
 a request along a chain of potential
  handlers until it is handled.

Benefits: Decouples senders and 
receivers, promotes flexibility 
in handling requests, and allows 
for dynamic addition or modification of handlers.

================
Command Pattern:
================

Description: Encapsulates a request 
as an object, allowing clients to
 parameterize clients with queues,
  requests, or operations.

Benefits: Decouples the sender of a
 request from the receiver, supports
  undo/redo functionality, and provides
   extensibility in command composition.

====================
Interpreter Pattern:
====================

Description: Defines a representation
 of a grammar and an interpreter
  to interpret sentences in the language.

Benefits: Enables the creation of a 
language or domain-specific expressions, 
facilitates extensibility in language
 interpretation, and supports complex
  rule-based systems.

=================
Iterator Pattern:
=================

Description: Provides a way to access 
the elements of an aggregate object sequentially
 without exposing its underlying representation.

Benefits: Simplifies the traversal of
 collections, supports multiple traversal
  algorithms, and promotes the principle 
  of encapsulation.

=================
Mediator Pattern:
=================

Description: Defines an object that
 encapsulates the communication between 
 a set of objects, promoting loose coupling.

Benefits: Reduces direct dependencies 
between objects, simplifies object
 interactions, and enhances maintainability
  by centralizing communication logic.

================
Memento Pattern:
================

Description: Captures and restores an
 object's internal state.

Benefits: Allows an object to be restored
 to a previous state, provides undo/redo
  functionality, and ensures encapsulation
   of state storage.

=================
Observer Pattern:
=================

Description: Defines a one-to-many dependency 
between objects, where changes in one object
 notify and update others automatically.

Benefits: Promotes loose coupling between 
objects, enables event-driven systems, and 
facilitates real-time communication and 
synchronization.

==============
State Pattern:
==============

Description: Allows an object to alter
 its behavior when its internal state changes.

Benefits: Encapsulates state-specific
 behavior, simplifies conditional logic,
  and promotes the principle of open-closed design.

=================
Strategy Pattern:
=================

Description: Defines a family of algorithms,
 encapsulates each one, and makes them
  interchangeable.

Benefits: Enables runtime algorithm selection,
 promotes code reuse and flexibility,
  and allows for easy addition of new strategies.

========================
Template Method Pattern:
========================

Description: Defines the skeleton 
of an algorithm in a base class, 
allowing subclasses to redefine certain steps.

Benefits: Provides a reusable algorithm 
framework, allows customization of specific
 steps, and promotes code reuse and extensibility.

================
Visitor Pattern:
================

Description: Separates an algorithm 
from the object structure on which it 
operates, allowing new operations to be 
added without modifying the objects.

Benefits: Enables adding new operations
 without modifying existing classes, 
 promotes extensibility, and avoids violating
  the open-closed principle.
