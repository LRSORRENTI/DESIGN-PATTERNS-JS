===================
CREATIONAL PATTERN: 

BUILDER

===================

The builder pattern is a creational design pattern 
that allows the building of complex objects step by 
step by separating the construction of an object from 
it's representation 

It provides a way to create an object by initializing 
it's properties in a step-by-step manner rather than 
using a giant constructor function 

This pattern is commonly used in software engineering 
when there's a need to create objects that have 
multiple properties that need to be set in a 
specific order 

The builder pattern is very useful when there are 
many possible optional properties and when the object 
being created is complex

1. Flexibility: The builder pattern facilitates the 
   ability to create objects in a flexible way, allowing 
   configuration and modification of properties step-by-step
