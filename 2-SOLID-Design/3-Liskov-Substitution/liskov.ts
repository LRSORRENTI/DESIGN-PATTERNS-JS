/* 
============================
LISKOV SUBSTITUTION AKA: LSP
============================

Now let's go over the Liskov principle, 
introduced by Barbara Liskov, during a 
comference on data abstraction and 
hierarchy

let's see the implementation guidelines of LSP

Substitution is a principle of OOP, 
and it states that: 

"S" is a subtype of "T", then objects 
of type "T" may be replaced with objects 
of type "S"

Which means derived types must be completely 
subsitutable for their base types 

LSP is a particular definition of a subtyping 
relation called STRONG BEHAVIORAL SUBTYPING 

It can be seen as an extension of the open-closed 
principle
