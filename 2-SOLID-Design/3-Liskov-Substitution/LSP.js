/* 
=================
Substitutability
=================

In OOP, it's said that: 

If S is a subtype of T,
then objects of type T,
are interchangeable with
objects of type S

This means that if a program is written
 to work with objects of type T, 
 it should be able to work just as 
 well with objects of type S, 
 as long as S is a subtype of T. 
 
 In other words, objects of type S 
 should be able to seamlessly substitute
  for objects of type T in any part of 
  the program without causing any errors
   or unexpected behavior.

By following the Liskov Substitution 
Principle, we can create more flexible
 and extensible code that is easier 
 to maintain and modify over time. 
 
 It allows us to write code that can
  be easily extended or modified by 
  adding new subtypes, without having 
  to rewrite large portions of the 
  existing code.
