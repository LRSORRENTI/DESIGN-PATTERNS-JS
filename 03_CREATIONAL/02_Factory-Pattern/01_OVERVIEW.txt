Factory Design Pattern in TypeScript
-Theo Anderson YouTube

Factory is a way to delegate instantiation of 
objects into what's known as a Factory

We're going to use TypeScript to showcase

This organization factory will house a list of 
employees to implement an interface called 
'iEmployee' 

This will showcase an apt example of the factory 
pattern
