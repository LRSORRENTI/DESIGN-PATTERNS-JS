==================
SINGLETON PATTERN
==================

What is the singleton pattern? 

It's when we create a single object, that shares 
resources throughout your application, 

It looks like: 


         OBJECT A-------------   --------OBJECT B
                            |   |
                          SINGLETON
                        SHARED RESOURCE
                         STORED STATE
                            |  |
        OBJECT C-------------  -------------OBJECT D
