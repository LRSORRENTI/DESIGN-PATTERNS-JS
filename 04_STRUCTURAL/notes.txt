================
Adapter Pattern:
================

Description: Converts the
 interface of a class into 
 another interface that clients expect.

Benefits: Allows incompatible classes
 to work together, promotes code 
 reusability, and provides a way
  to adapt legacy code.

===============
Bridge Pattern:
===============

Description: Separates an abstraction 
from its implementation so that they can
 vary independently.

Benefits: Decouples abstraction and 
implementation, promotes flexibility 
and extensibility, and allows for easier
 system evolution.

==================
Composite Pattern:
==================

Description: Composes objects into 
tree structures to represent part-whole 
hierarchies.

Benefits: Simplifies the 
handling of complex hierarchies, 
allows treating individual and 
composed objects uniformly, and 
provides flexibility in object composition.

==================
Decorator Pattern:
==================

Description: Dynamically adds
 responsibilities to objects by wrapping them.

Benefits: Allows for flexible and dynamic
 object behavior extension, promotes the
  principle of open-closed design,
   and avoids class explosion due to 
   excessive subclassing.

===============
Facade Pattern:
===============

Description: Provides a unified interface
 to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

Benefits: Simplifies the usage of complex
 subsystems, provides a higher-level 
 interface for clients, and reduces 
 dependencies between clients and subsystems.

==================
Flyweight Pattern:
==================

Description: Shares common state among
 multiple objects to conserve memory.

Benefits: Reduces memory usage by sharing
 data, improves performance by avoiding 
 redundant object creation, and supports
  large-scale systems with a large 
  number of fine-grained objects.

==============
Proxy Pattern:
==============

Description: Provides a surrogate or
 placeholder for another object to control 
 access to it.

Benefits: Adds an additional layer of
 indirection for controlling object access,
  provides a level of abstraction for
   security or performance optimizations, and 
   allows for lazy initialization
    and on-demand object creation.
