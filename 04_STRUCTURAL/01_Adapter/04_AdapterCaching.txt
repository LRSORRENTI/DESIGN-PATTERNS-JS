QUICK NOTE ABOUT ADAPTER CACHING
================================

In the context of adapter patterns, 
"adapter caching" refers to a technique 
where the adapter stores the results of
expensive or frequently performed
operations for later use. 
  
This caching mechanism can help 
improve performance by avoiding
redundant computations.

Let's break it down with an example. 
Suppose you have a legacy system
that provides weather information 
in Celsius, but your client code 
requires the weather information
in Fahrenheit. 
  
You create an adapter that converts
the Celsius temperature to 
Fahrenheit for the client code.

Now, let's say the client code 
frequently requests weather
information for the same location
and you notice that the conversion 
from Celsius to Fahrenheit is a
computationally expensive operation.
   
 In this scenario, you can introduce
 caching within the adapter.

=================================
Here's how it can be implemented:
=================================

1. When the adapter receives a request 
for weather information in Fahrenheit 
for a specific location, it first checks 
\if the conversion for that location is 
already cached.

2. If the conversion is cached,
 the adapter retrieves the result 
 from the cache and returns it to 
 the client code without performing 
 the conversion again.

3. If the conversion is not cached,
the adapter performs the Celsius to
Fahrenheit conversion, stores the
result in the cache for future use,
and then returns the converted value 
to the client code.

By caching the results, 
subsequent requests for the same 
location can be served directly
from the cache, eliminating the
need for repetitive computations 
and improving the overall
performance of the system.

It's worth noting that caching in 
the adapter pattern is not a
mandatory feature. It depends
on the specific requirements 
and performance considerations
of your application. 
   
The decision to implement caching 
within the adapter would be based
on factors such as the frequency of requests,
the cost of the operation, and the 
expected benefits 
in terms of performance optimization.
