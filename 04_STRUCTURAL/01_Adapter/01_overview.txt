ADAPTER PATTERN
===============

The adapter design pattern allows for different 
classes to be made with different interfaces 
work together, without changing their source code 

Real world example: 

If we're traveling from the USA to Europe, 
if we want to charge our phone, and devices, we 
need an adapter for our prongs, in the EU they use 
different electrical outlets

In this example, our adapter must implement the 
EU plug, and expose the USA prongs to be used 

Let's look at a TypeScript example
